\subsection{Web Client}

The web client is designed to be a simple interface through which simulations for each of the modules can be run and automated, both separately and jointly. We have currently implemented a prototype using Bottle and MongoDB of the interface for the pattern-recognition module. This graphical user interface provides the minimal functionality needed to create sample spike trains, test pattern-recognition neurons against them and save the results of each experiment, providing key insight to the effect of each parameter on the output.
