Instructions
------------
In order to launch our application you first need to make sure
that you download the dependencies listed in the requirements
folder as well as MongoDB. Note that this list is not comprehensive
and additional requirements may be needed depending on your particular
environment. Once you have these ready, you can start up the
tool by following the steps below.

1. Start up a MongoDB instance on `localhost` and port `27017`.
2. Install our local dependencies by running `install.sh` from `utils/`
3. Run server.py from `src/server/`.
4. If at this point you get any dependency issues, ensure that
you install these.
5. Using the browser of your choice, access the tool through
`localhost:8090`.
