	when do we want to finish this?
	What is acceptable?
	What is ideal?
	Set the ideal target in the date we want to finish this stage..


Jobs:
	Make retina input
	Make a representation (eg. array) in python that corresponds to the 2D visual field of the dragonfly. 
	We will try to make this to work as an event based camera which is how retinas work. (Neurons fire only when pixels change colour.)
	Simulate a similar experiment to the experiment in the 2013 paper, with two inputs moving in different directions.

	Architecture
	Check the architecture we have now. Is it enough according to this second paper? 
	Yes would mean that the retina will fit on top of this network.
	One of the most critical things to consider is the number of neurons. We'll try to have the least possible, 
	so it's easy to work in real time..

	Organize/run the experiment
	We want to check the free parameters of the model, (no of synapses, potassium, etc) to find a subset where
	we can better observe the phenomenon of the 2013 paper. This would require the definition of a metric 
	(fitness function) which could be the degree in which T1&T2 firing rates match to either T1 or T2.

Initial jobs:
	learn basics SNN + python


This goes to retina input: Neuron: find a way to stimulate the cells with changes in real time - maybe only this is enough..

~3 papers: Neuron, architecture, etc
